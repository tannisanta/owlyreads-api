# OwlyReads Catalog API

## Overview

OwlyReads Catalog API is a showcase project that demonstrates API documentation for managing book inventories across franchise locations.

It allows stores to update titles, authors, categories, pricing, and availability efficiently and consistently across all connected systems.

### Key features for franchise stores:

- Add new books or update existing details
- Keep stock and availability consistent across all locations
- Provide real-time inventory information to staff
- Search and filter books by title, author, category, or series

The API ensures that changes made in one place are reflected everywhere, reducing errors and saving time for staff and developers.

## Technical writing approach

The API documentation is designed with clarity, consistency, and user focus in mind. Key principles applied include:  

- **Global English**: Simple, clear language suitable for international developers  
- **Consistency**: Uniform naming, formatting, and terminology across all endpoints and schemas  
- **Backward compatibility guidance**: Non-breaking and breaking changes are clearly distinguished  
- **Readable examples**: Each schema and endpoint includes concrete examples to illustrate correct usage  
- **Minimal noise**: Avoid unnecessary technical jargon, Latinisms, or redundant phrases  
- **Contextual changelog**: Each update explains the purpose and impact on integration
